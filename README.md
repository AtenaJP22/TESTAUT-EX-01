# TESTAUT-EX-01
Testaut-Ex-01 Exercise at İ2İ Systems Software Internship

As part of the TESTAUT-EX-01 exercise for the i2i Academy Test Automation module, I developed a Selenium-based Java application to automate the login process of a demo e-commerce website. Using Maven for dependency management and running the project in Visual Studio Code, I created a test script that launches a Chrome browser, navigates to saucedemo.com, enters predefined login credentials, and verifies successful login by checking the resulting URL. I configured the project with the appropriate Selenium dependencies and ChromeDriver setup on macOS. After verifying the test’s successful execution through console output and browser interaction, I documented the process and pushed the full working project to GitHub.
